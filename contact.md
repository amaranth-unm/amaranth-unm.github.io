# Get in Touch!
We are excited to work with you!

Soon you'll be able to use our shiny new amaranth email address, but until that's fully connected, please email Jonathan Seyfreid (jseyfreid@unm.edu) or Fred Gibbs (fwgibbs@unm.edu) with any questions or suggestions.

## Book time in the Studio
Our preferred method for scheduling is to use our [bookings page](https://outlook.office.com/book/HistoryAmaranth@unmm.onmicrosoft.com/?ismsaljsauthenabled). This page is managed through UNM's Microsoft Teams, and it helps us keep our calendar organized, especially during crunch times of the semester  

On that pages, we ask that you describe as much as you can what you're interested in discussing or doing so we can be most prepared to help.
