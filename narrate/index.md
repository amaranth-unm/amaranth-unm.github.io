---

A research paper argues through evidence and citation. A ScrollStory argues through pacing, image, and spatial rhythm. An oral history argues through voice---through the weight of a pause, the texture of lived experience. A podcast argues through conversation, through the intimacy of someone thinking out loud in your ear.

These aren't lesser forms of scholarship. They're different ways of reaching people, and each one demands its own kind of care. Choosing the right medium for your story isn't a technical decision. It's an intellectual one---and it changes what your audience is able to understand.

We help you figure out which medium fits what you're trying to say, and then we help you say it well.


## ScrollStories

A ScrollStory treats a webpage not as a document but as a designed experience. Backgrounds shift, text emerges, and readers move through your argument the way they'd move through an exhibit---at their own pace, guided by visual choices you've made deliberately. Built on the same open-source tools as our websites, so your story lives in files you own.

## Oral Histories

An oral history is more than an interview. It's a relationship between narrator and listener shaped by trust, preparation, and ethical care. Done well, it preserves not just what someone said, but how they said it---and helps explain why it matters.

## Podcasting

A podcast lets you bring your ideas to people where they already are---on a commute, a walk, doing dishes. It demands a different kind of writing than academic prose: conversational, structured around curiosity, designed to hold attention through narrative rather than citation. That shift in register isn't a compromise. It's a skill.

## Getting started with audio

You don't need professional equipment or experience. A phone and a quiet room get you surprisingly far, and the [YETI mics](/equipment/yeti-mics) in the studio are available for higher-quality recording. We have guides for [recording audio](/narrate/recording) and [editing with Audacity](/narrate/audacity)---a free, open-source editor that's more than capable for humanities audio work.

The hardest part isn't the technology. It's deciding what story you want to tell and whose voice should tell it. We can help with that too.
