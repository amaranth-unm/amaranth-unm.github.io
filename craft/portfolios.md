# Own your professional identity

Your scholarly work shouldn't live on someone else's platform. When your professional presence is scattered across institutional pages, social media, and email, you're building on ground that can shift without warning---a university redesigns its faculty pages, a platform changes its policies, an account gets locked. A portfolio website that you own and control is different. It moves with you between institutions, costs nothing to maintain, and presents your work the way you want it seen.

A well-designed portfolio showcases your research, teaching, and projects in ways that a CV alone cannot. Hiring committees and funding agencies increasingly look for an online presence. Publications, syllabi, digital projects, media appearances---a portfolio site gives all of that a permanent, public home.


## Built to last

Our portfolio sites run on GitHub Pages---free, open, and built on web standards that have been around for decades. No subscription fees, no ads, no proprietary lock-in. What you build today will still work years from now with zero upkeep. Your site is just text files in a repository that belongs to you.


## Digital fluency, not coding

Building a portfolio teaches you how the web actually works: how content is structured with Markdown, how styling shapes design, how version control lets you experiment without fear. You don't need to be a programmer. But understanding how digital projects work is increasingly essential in every field, and the confidence that comes from building something real is invaluable.


## Getting started

Our [getting started guide](https://xanthan-web.github.io/docs/getting-started) walks through the process step by step. Check out a few examples below of academic portfolios built with our platform, or [get in touch](../collaborate) to talk about yours.
