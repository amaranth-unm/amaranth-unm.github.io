## Don't build on borrowed ground
Your scholarly work shouldn't live in someone else's database. A portfolio website that you own and control is different. It moves with you between institutions, costs nothing to maintain, and presents your work the way you want it seen.

A well-designed portfolio showcases your research, teaching, and projects in ways that a CV alone cannot. Publications, syllabi, digital projects, media appearances---a portfolio site gives all of that a permanent, public home so you and your ideas remain visible.


## Built to last
Our portfolio sites run on GitHub Pages---free, open, and built on web standards that have been around for decades. No subscription fees, no ads, no proprietary lock-in. What you build today will still work years from now with zero upkeep. Your site is just text files in a repository that belongs to you.


## Digital fluency, not coding
Building a portfolio teaches you a lot about communication: how to highlight what's most important, how styling shapes design, how to match tone to audience, how to balance different facets of your public identity. You also learn how to organize and structure information for digtial display. Understanding how digital projects work is increasingly essential in every field, and the confidence that comes from building something real is invaluable.
