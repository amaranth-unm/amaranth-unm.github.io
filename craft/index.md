# Build things that last

Every design choice is an argument. The typeface on an academic poster says something about the work it presents. The structure of a website shapes how readers encounter your ideas. A 3D-printed artifact is a claim about what matters in material culture. Craft isn't decoration applied after the thinking is done---it's part of the thinking.

We help students, scholars, and communities build work that takes design seriously: websites, posters, and physical objects where the *how* reinforces the *what*. Everything we build uses open-source tools, costs nothing to maintain, and belongs entirely to the people who make it.


## Websites

The best humanities work deserves more than a PDF buried in a course management system. When students and scholars build on the open web, their work becomes public, collaborative, and durable---visible to audiences beyond a single classroom or conference, and built to outlast the platforms that come and go.

Every site we build runs on [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io), our open-source template system---free to host, easy to maintain, and yours to keep forever.

- **[Class projects](class-projects)** --- A collaborative website transforms a course assignment into a shared intellectual project. Students contribute work that adds up to something larger than any individual could produce alone.
- **[Portfolios](portfolios)** --- Your professional identity shouldn't depend on a platform you don't control. A portfolio gives you a permanent home for your scholarship, teaching, and projects.
- **[Gallery](gallery)** --- See what others have built.


## Posters

A well-designed poster distills complex research into a visual argument that works at a glance. We help with design thinking---hierarchy, typography, visual rhythm---and provide large-format printing on our HP DesignJet T630.

## 3D Prints

Need to print a model for a class, a presentation, or an experiment? Our [printing guides](/3d-printing) walk you through the process from finding a model to pulling it off the printer. If you're interested in the research side of 3D printing in the humanities, see [Explore](/explore).


## Getting started

You don't need to know how to code. If you can edit a text file, you can build a site. Our [getting started guide](https://xanthan-web.github.io/docs/getting-started) walks you through the process, and we're always happy to help in person at the [studio](/studio) or over email at <amaranth@unm.edu>.
