## Every design choice is an argument

Building is a form of thinking. When you make a website for your research, a poster for a conference, or a 3D-printed object for a class, you face decisions that prose alone never forces: Who is this for? What does it feel like to encounter? What goes first? Those decisions aren't peripheral to your scholarship. They shape what your audience is able to understand—and whether they engage at all.

Every design choice is an argument. The structure of a website tells readers what you think matters. A typeface says something about the register of the work. An image is an editorial claim. Craft isn't decoration applied after the thinking is done—it's part of the thinking. And when you share something you've built, you discover what you actually think. Vague ideas don't survive contact with a real audience.

We help students, scholars, and communities build things worth building. Not as a service—as a collaboration. You bring the ideas; we help translate them into forms that reach people and last.


## Websites

The best humanities work deserves more than a PDF buried in a course management system. When students and scholars build on the open web, their work becomes public, durable, and visible to audiences beyond a single classroom or conference.

Every site we build runs on [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io), our open-source template system—free to host, easy to maintain, and yours to keep. No subscription fees. No platform lock-in.

- **[Class projects](class-projects)** — A collaborative website transforms a course assignment into a shared intellectual project. Students contribute work that adds up to something larger than any individual could build alone.
- **[Portfolios](portfolios)** — Your professional identity shouldn't depend on a platform you don't control. A portfolio gives you a permanent home for your scholarship, teaching, and projects.
- **[Communities](communities)** — Websites for organizations, archives, and groups who need a durable digital presence they actually own.
- **[Gallery](gallery)** — See what others have built.

## Posters

A well-designed poster distills complex research into a visual argument that works at a glance. We help with design thinking—hierarchy, typography, visual rhythm—and provide large-format printing on our HP DesignJet T630.

## 3D Prints

Need to print a model for a class, a presentation, or an experiment? If you're interested in the research side of 3D printing in the humanities, see [Explore](/explore).

## Getting started

You don't need to know how to code. If you can edit a text file, you can build a site. Our [getting started guide](https://xanthan-web.github.io/docs/getting-started) walks you through the process, and we're always happy to help in person at [studio hours](/collaborate) or over email at <amaranth@unm.edu>.
