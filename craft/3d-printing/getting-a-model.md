# How to Get a 3D Printable Model
For those new to 3D printing, downloading a free 3D model offers the best way to get practice with the process. 

## Online Repositories for 3D Models
We recommend the following repositories for models available under fair use copyright:
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- [Scan the World](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Scan%20The%20World?show=store)

## Recommendations for File Format
Some repositories offer several options for file format when downloading a model. We recommend .3mf or .stl as the easiest file formats to work with in Orca Slicer.

## Create a Folder for 3D Print Files
Initially, your downloaded 3D model will appear in the Downloads folder on your computer. As you continue with 3D printing, you will find it easier if you have all your 3D printing files in one separate folder on your Desktop or in Documents.

## Ready to Slice
Once you have the downloaded file in a desired folder location, you are ready for slicing.
