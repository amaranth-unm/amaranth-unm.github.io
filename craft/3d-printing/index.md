## It's simpler than it looks.

3D printing turns digital models into physical things you can hold, compare, and learn from. The process is simpler than it looks: find or scan a model, prepare it with slicing software, and send it to the printer. Most of the work is in the preparation---once your file is ready, the printer does the rest.

The guides below walk through each step.


## Getting a model
Whether you download an existing scan from a repository like [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) or [Scan The World](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Scan%20The%20World?show=store), or digitize a physical object with our [3D scanner](/equipment/3d-scanner), you'll end up with a file that describes the shape of your object. Our [getting a model](getting-a-model) guide covers the options.


## Slicing
Slicing software takes your 3D model and converts it into layer-by-layer instructions for the printer---like slicing an onion into cross-sections that the printer rebuilds one at a time. We use Orca Slicer on the studio iMacs, already configured for our Anycubic Kobra 3. Our [slicing guide](slicing) walks through the settings.


## Printing
Once your file is sliced, save it to a USB drive and bring it to the printer. The steps are straightforward---the poster above the printer covers everything you need.
