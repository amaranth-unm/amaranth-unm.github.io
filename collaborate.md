# Let's work together

Whether you're a teacher looking for a digital home for a class project, a student bringing a course assignment to life, or a researcher building something new---we can help you move from idea to reality.

Please email us at <amaranth@unm.edu> with questions or suggestions.


## Drop by studio hours (Spring 2026)
- Tuesdays & Thursdays: 9:30--11:00 and 12:30--2:00
- Wednesdays: 10:00--12:00


## Book time in the Studio

Our preferred method for scheduling is to use our [bookings page](https://outlook.office.com/book/HistoryAmaranth@unmm.onmicrosoft.com/?ismsaljsauthenabled). This page is managed through UNM's Microsoft Teams, and it helps us keep our calendar organized, especially during crunch times of the semester. Please describe as much as you can what you're interested in discussing or doing so we can be most prepared to help.


## Grant projects and public-facing research

Many grants---from the NEH, Mellon, NSF, and others---now expect or encourage a public engagement component: a way for research to reach audiences beyond the academy. We can help you design and build that component.

If you're writing a grant proposal, we can work with you to plan a realistic digital deliverable---a project website, a collection of ScrollStory essays, an interactive archive, an oral history series---and provide a credible description of the technical infrastructure and support for your proposal. We've helped faculty articulate digital components that strengthen applications by demonstrating concrete plans for public impact.

If you already have funding, we can serve as a production partner for the public-facing side of your project. We provide the design thinking, technical infrastructure, and hands-on support to turn research into something that communicates to a broader audience---without requiring your team to learn web development or manage hosting. Everything we build is open-source, sustainable, and yours to keep.

This kind of collaboration works best when it starts early. If you're even thinking about a grant that might have a digital or public-facing dimension, reach out---the earlier we can talk about possibilities, the stronger the proposal.
