## 3D Printing using Orca Slicer (software app) and the Anycubic Kobra 3 Printer (hardware)

The slicing software creates instructions for how to print an object for a particular printer. On the Mac workstations in the History Tech Lab, the software is set to default to the printer we have: the Anycubic Kobra 3. If you want to slice a model on your own computer, choose the correct version of Orca to download by visiting [their Github page](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases). You can choose which of the four loaded filaments you want to use for your print. Watch these videos further down on this page for helpful step-by-step tutorials.

## Tips for Preparing the Print File

- Open the Orca Slicer application and ensure that the Anycubic Kobra 3 printer is selected. The printer settings should look like the below.

- Ensure the filament type matches the one loaded in the printer.

- Adjust the print settings (e.g., layer height, infill percentage) based on your desired print quality.

- Save the sliced file to an SD card or USB drive for printing.

## Printing Process

1. Insert the SD card or USB drive into the Anycubic Kobra 3 printer.
2. Select the file you want to print from the printer's menu.
3. Start the print and monitor the first few layers to ensure proper adhesion.
4. Wait for the print to complete and allow it to cool before removing it from the print bed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Poor Adhesion**: Ensure the print bed is clean and properly leveled.
- **Stringing**: Adjust the retraction settings in the slicer software.
- **Warping**: Use a heated bed and apply adhesive if necessary.

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Anycubic Kobra 3 manual](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/download) or the [Orca Slicer documentation](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki).
