# Start Here

This section of our site will help you to get oriented to the major areas of digital humanities.

## What to Expect from the Orientations

In each Orientation section, you will get a short explanation of a particular area or tool for the digital humanities. This information will help you get a start with your upcoming projects and help you to make the most out of the services and training provided by the Amaranth Studio.
