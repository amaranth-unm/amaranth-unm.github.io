# Nuturing Communities
You've organized an important workshop that gathers together leading scholars of your field. Everyone contributes forward-thinking pieces on future research directions.

The conference ends, and participants go their own way. While each scholar goes off to propogate the insights from the workshop, the workshop and the intellectual work it's done itself largely vanishes. Sound familiar?

Amaranth helps solves that problem by making it easy to keep papers online, organized, and accessible. No expensive hosting, no institutional servers that mysteriously vanish, no endless email chains asking, “Hey, do you still have a copy of that thing?”

Scholarship should be open, accessible, and built to last. That’s why we use GitHub Pages--—a free, stable platform that makes our workshop papers easy to access anywhere in the world, long after the event itself is over. It will keep conference and workshop conversations alive, accessible, and easy to share—because scholarship deserves better than a forgotten folder called “Workshop2023_FINAL_v2_REALFINAL.pdf.”

Our site runs on the Xanthan template, which gives us a clean, elegant design without requiring complex web development skills. This means you can focus on what matters most: sharing ideas and sparking conversations. Most importantly, it’s a model that supports the values of open scholarship: transparency, sustainability, and access for everyone.


## Histories of the Future
In early 2015, a group of historians of science gathered at Princeton to discuss the represetations of history in science fiction. Using a prototype verion of the platform that Amaranth uses today, the workshop's proceeding, participants, and existence remain well-preserved with literally zero upkeep or maintenace.
