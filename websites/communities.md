# Keep the conversation alive

You've organized an important workshop that gathers leading scholars of your field. Everyone contributes forward-thinking pieces on future research directions. The conference ends, participants go their own way---and the intellectual work it produced largely vanishes. Sound familiar?

Scholarship deserves better than a forgotten folder called "Workshop2023_FINAL_v2_REALFINAL.pdf."

We make it easy to keep papers online, organized, and accessible---no expensive hosting, no institutional servers that mysteriously disappear, no endless email chains asking "Hey, do you still have a copy of that thing?" Our sites run on GitHub Pages, a free, stable platform that keeps workshop and conference work available to anyone in the world, long after the event itself is over.

The sites are built with [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io), which provides a clean, elegant design without requiring web development skills. You focus on the ideas; the platform handles the rest. It's a model built on the values of open scholarship: transparency, sustainability, and access for everyone.


## Histories of the Future
In early 2015, a group of historians of science [gathered at Princeton](https://history.princeton.edu/news-events/events/histories-future) to discuss representations of history in science fiction. Using a prototype version of the platform that Amaranth uses today, the workshop's proceedings, participants, and existence remain well-preserved with literally zero upkeep or maintenance.
