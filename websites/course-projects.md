# Collaborative Course Project Websites
This overview explains how we help instructors create collaborative websites for displaying student work. These websites demonstrate what collaborative digital history can be: a group of students contribute small articles that collectively add up to something useful, creating something that one person alone couldnâ€™t do in a reasonable timeframe. The course website will be a collaborative sustainable digital projects.

## Public Engagement
Instead of an audience of only the course instructor, students will have the chance to share their coursework for a wider audience. This helps increase the authenticity of assessment and encourages our students to think about how to improve public engagement with the humanities. 

## Digital Literacy
Many popular website creation apps, such as Wordpress or Wix, place limits on design and function. When creating a website in a hurry, those apps get the basic job done. However, these apps involve so many layers of code that even someone with web design experience cannot understand how they work. In addition, these apps diminish student agency over the look-and-feel of the page they contribute to the website. Our process results in a website with similar design features as a Wordpress website, but will also help students gain experience with website design and introductory coding. The steps that we have designed reinforce a collaborative ethos and provide a clear picture of how basic code produces design elements on a page. 

## Let's Get Started
If you are interested in any of the above, let's talk about building a website together for your student projects. We've got the technical infrastructure set up and the documentation of instructions for you and your students. We're happy to visit classes to help.
