# Websites of all shapes and sizes

## Collaborative Course Projects
We help instructors create collaborative websites that collect, display, and preserve student work. These websites demonstrate what collaborative digital history can be: a group of students contribute small articles that collectively add up to something useful, creating something that one person alone couldn’t do in a reasonable timeframe. The course website will be a collaborative sustainable digital projects.

## Community Partnerships
Instead of an audience of only the course instructor, students will have the chance to share their coursework for a wider audience. This helps increase the authenticity of assessment and encourages our students to think about how to improve public engagement with the humanities. 

## Workshop Preservation
Academic workshops often produce exciting, creative work—but too often, that work disappears as soon as the event ends. Amaranth helps solves that problem by making it easy to keep papers online, organized, and accessible. No expensive hosting, no institutional servers that mysteriously vanish, no endless email chains asking, “Hey, do you still have a copy of that thing?”. 


## Let's Get Started
If you are interested in any of the above, let's talk about building a website together. We've got the technical infrastructure set up and the documentation of instructions, and we're happy to adding to our repertoire.
