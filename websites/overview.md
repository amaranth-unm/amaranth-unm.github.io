# Websites Overview
We created a super easy-to-use template system called [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io) to build sustainable websites quickly that keep you in control of your files, your content, and your site. It's getting started guide and extension reference documentation can get you going and keep you building for a long time. We've set up a few templates customized for our most requested sites.

First things first: **You'll never need to learn any web programming skills to add to or revise your website!** If you can copy and paste from our example pages, you can easily create and customized your site! Of course if you do learn some web basics, you'll have a lot more control. But first things first.


## Collaborative Class Projects
We help instructors create collaborative websites that collect, display, and preserve student work. These websites demonstrate what collaborative digital history can be: a group of students contribute small articles that collectively add up to something useful, creating something that one person alone couldn’t do in a reasonable timeframe.

## Independent Studies / Honors / etc
Students doing independent projects may want benefit from a flexible digital format for their work. If so, we can help! Using the same process and platform as we do for course sites, we can help students create their own digital project site or page. [Read more about scrollstories →](scrollstories)

## Academic Communities
Academic workshops often produce exciting, creative work—but too often, that work disappears as soon as the event ends. Amaranth helps solves that problem by making it easy to keep papers online, organized, and accessible. No expensive hosting, no institutional servers that mysteriously vanish, no endless email chains asking, “Hey, do you still have a copy of that thing?”.

## Portfolio Websites
A personal portfolio website helps you showcase your ongoing projects, maintain visibility in your field, and create a free digital space for your scholarly outputs. Whether you're sharing research, linking to your CV, or highlighting creative work, a portfolio gives you control over your professional presence and preserves your work for the long term.
