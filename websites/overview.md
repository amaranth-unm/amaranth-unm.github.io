# Build something that lasts

The best humanities work deserves more than a PDF buried in a course management system. When students, scholars, and communities build on the open web, their work becomes public, collaborative, and durable---visible to audiences beyond a single classroom or conference, and built to outlast the platforms that come and go.

We help people design and build websites that treat the web itself as a medium for humanities work. Every site we build runs on [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io), our open-source template system---free to host, easy to maintain, and yours to keep forever.


## Collaborative class projects
A collaborative website transforms a course assignment into a shared intellectual project. Instead of writing for an audience of one, students contribute work that adds up to something larger than any individual could produce alone---a public resource that lives beyond the semester.

## Academic communities
Workshops and conferences generate some of the most forward-thinking scholarship in a field---and then it vanishes. A shared website keeps that work accessible, organized, and alive long after the event ends. No subscription fees, no institutional servers that quietly disappear, no forgotten email attachments.

## Professional portfolios
Your professional identity shouldn't depend on a platform you don't control. A portfolio website gives you a permanent home for your scholarship, teaching, and projects---one that moves with you between institutions, costs nothing to maintain, and demonstrates the digital fluency that employers and funding agencies increasingly expect.

## Getting started
You don't need to know how to code. If you can edit a text file, you can build a site. Our [getting started guide](https://xanthan-web.github.io/docs/getting-started) walks you through the process, and we're always happy to help in person at the [studio](/studio) or over email at <amaranth@unm.edu>.
