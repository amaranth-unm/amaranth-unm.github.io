# Portfolio Websites for Academics

Building a professional portfolio website is one of the smartest investments you can make in your academic career—especially early on. A portfolio site gives you control over how you present your work, demonstrates your digital fluency to employers and colleagues, and creates a permanent home for your scholarship that won't disappear when you move between institutions or platforms.

## Own Your Academic Identity

When your professional presence is scattered across institutional pages, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email, you're building on someone else's platform—and you can lose everything if you change universities, if that platform changes its policies, or if someone else controls the account. A portfolio website that you own and control is different. Your site is just text files in a GitHub repository that belongs to you. After graduation, between institutions, or to your own domain—it's yours to take with you.

## Reach Beyond Traditional Channels

Hiring committees and funding agencies increasingly check portfolios online. A well-organized, professionally designed site showcases your research, teaching philosophy, digital projects, and impact in ways that a CV alone cannot. You can include publications (with links to PDFs if paywalls block them), syllabi, course projects, media appearances, and other work that demonstrates your scholarly contribution. It's public engagement that also serves your career.

## Sustainable by Design

Most commercial website builders look great on day one, then disappear when you forget to renew your subscription or the company pivots. GitHub Pages sites are built on HTML, CSS, and Markdown—fundamental technologies that have been around for decades and will continue to work without any maintenance. What you build today will still work in 2050, with literally zero upkeep.

## Learn Digital Fluency (Without Learning to Code)

Building your site teaches you how the web actually works: how content is structured with Markdown, how styling shapes design with CSS, how version control lets you experiment without fear. These are increasingly essential skills in any field—not just tech. You don't need to be a programmer to understand how digital projects work, and that literacy matters. The combination of practical skills and the confidence that comes from building something real is invaluable.

## It's Free (and Stays Free)

GitHub Pages costs $0 per month. No ads. No "upgrade to pro" prompts. No bills when your traffic increases. That means you can host a polished, professional site forever without spending money or worrying about affordability.

## Why Not Squarespace or Wix?

Commercial site builders are convenient for quick projects, but they lock your content into proprietary systems. If the service changes, disappears, or changes its pricing model, your site is at risk. They also charge fees, require yearly subscriptions, and often display ads even on "free" plans. For serious, long-term professional presence, open tools built on web standards are the better choice.
