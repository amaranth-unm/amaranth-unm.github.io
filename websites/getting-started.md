# Getting Started
We are here to help guide you through the process of getting your website set up.

First things first: **You'll never need to learn any web programming skills to add to or revise your website!** There is no software to update, no servers to deal with. If you can move text files from one folder to another, you can make and maintain a website!


## The Big Picture
We've tried to create all the instructions you need to do things on your own, but there can be a lot to take in if you've never thought about making a website before. Below we've tried to sketch out the general overview of what happens.

### GitHub Pages as hosting platform
We'll help you get familiar and comfortable with a web hosting platform called GitHub Pages. It's a free, open source platform that's been around for a long time and hosts almost 500 million projects and websites. It's stable, mature, and safe. The idea is that you upload some text files there, and it makes a website for you. It is the standard platform for almost all digital cultural heritage projects. 

### Create your project website
First, we'll create a simple project site for you. We have directions you can follow, but we'll basically do this for you to get started. We'll start you off with a basic, bare-bones website (that we created specifically for this purpose) that you'll gradually add to. In GitHub speak, we create a "repository" for your site, which is just a fancy name for a folder that holds your stuff.

### Make your own copy
Once you have your website up and running, it's useful to work on a copy of that website instead of the "real" version. This makes it easy to experiment and learn without fear of breaking something. We'll walk you through the process of making your own copy of your site---meaning you simply duplicate the website repository in your own GitHub account. You can also just follow the directions on your own--it's just clicking a few buttons on GitHub!

### Edit away
To edit your website, you just need to navigate to your own repository on GitHub where your website copy lives (as distinct from the official, public version), edit a text file, and save your changes. GitHub automatically updates your website. When you are ready to make your changes to the "real" site, you click a few buttons on GitHub to merge the changes from your repository to the public repository.

### Students make stuff
When you are ready to use your site with students, we are here to support you!

For your students to contribute their work, your students will do _exactly_ what you did to edit the website. 
- Create a free GitHub account
- Duplicate the project website into their own GitHub repository. Again, this is _not_ a technical process; you just click a few buttons.
- Develop and add their own page(s) with their essay, images, podcast, etc.
  - These are just text files that they edit on their computers/tablets and then drag and drop into GitHub. No special software required.
- When the course is ending and their work is done, they click button to submit their changes to the "official" project site. 
- You (or anyone at Amaranth) clicks a button to accept these requests
- The official project site now has all the different pages that students created separately! 
- The "directory" page (whatever design you choose) will automatically link to all the student pages.

### Show off your site
It's exciting to see the power of collaboration at work even in a small class! Students love seeing their work take on a public life of its own instead of a just another Word doc they upload to Canvas.

### Collaborate with future students
Next time you teach a similar class---in one year or ten---and want students to contribute to the project, your site will be just as you left it and ready to go. GitHub Pages is entirely free, so there's no server or service to maintain in the meantime. Nothing can break in the meantime.
