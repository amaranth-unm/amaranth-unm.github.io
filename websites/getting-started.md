# Getting Started
We are here to help guide you through the process of getting your website set up. But here's the general outline.

## Initial Steps with Amaranth
We've tried to create all the instructions you need to do things on your own, but there can be a lot to take in if you've never thought about making a website before. Please book a time to talk to us and we can walk you through the concepts and first steps. 

- We'll help you get familiar and comfortable with the web hosting platform called GitHub Pages.
- We use a GitHub Pages template called Xanthan, that was designed specifically for the kinds of work we're doing. We'll help you follow [the Xanthan set up instructions](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/getting-started).

We'll create an "official" project website hosted by Amaranth. We'll help you make your own copy  


## A Summary of What Your Students Will Do
When you are ready to use your site with students, we are here to support you!

Just as you did, your students will also create a GitHub account. 

They will [fork the repository](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-setup.html) from Amaranth's GitHub account. 

Since they will make their repositories public, you will be able to see any changes they make. Each student will [create their own folder](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-new-page.html) and fill that folder with their images and a text file with the content of their page of the website. They will not make edits to any other part of the website. We recommend that students only submit a single pull request when they have finished making all changes. 

## A Few New Skills
You'll never need to learn any web programming skills to edit and maintain your website. 

But as a lo-tech, as opposed to no-tech solutions (like SquareSpace), you'll need to understand the basic building blocks of a website. To add images, or pull quotes or any stylistic features in your essay, you just need to copy and paste a few code "snippets", change a few parametes (like width:50% to width:75%) and you're done.

This simplified coding language is called [markdown](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/samples/typography).
