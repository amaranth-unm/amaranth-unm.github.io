# Getting Started
We are here to help guide you through the process! But here's the general outline.

## Initial Steps with Amaranth

We'll help you get familiar and comfortable with the web hosting platform GitHub.

We'll help you follow [the Xanthan set up instructions](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/getting-started).

This will help you create a basic website template. We'll give you a tour of [the various places in the repository](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/understanding-your-site) that hold files that you will edit to make the website specific to your course.

This sort of is your "official" project website. But it's best to 

Then you can begin typing over the placeholder text for [the title](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/editing-your-site) of the website. Once you have finished making changes for the day, you will request a merge with the repository in Amaranth. This process is called submitting a 'pull request.' 


## A Summary of What Your Students Will Do
When you are ready to use your site with students, we are here to support you!

Just as you did, your students will also create a GitHub account. 

They will [fork the repository](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-setup.html) from Amaranth's GitHub account. 

Since they will make their repositories public, you will be able to see any changes they make. Each student will [create their own folder](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-new-page.html) and fill that folder with their images and a text file with the content of their page of the website. They will not make edits to any other part of the website. We recommend that students only submit a single pull request when they have finished making all changes. 

## A Few New Skills
You'll never need to learn any web programming skills to edit and maintain your website. 

But as a lo-tech, as opposed to no-tech solutions (like SquareSpace), you'll need to understand the basic building blocks of a website. To add images, or pull quotes or any stylistic features in your essay, you just need to copy and paste a few code "snippets", change a few parametes (like width:50% to width:75%) and you're done.

This simplified coding language is called [markdown](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/samples/typography).
