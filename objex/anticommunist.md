## Memorial to the Victims of Communism

We chose the 3D model of this statue from the [Scan the World](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-women-and-children-communism-memorial-london-3411) repository because of its texture. 

The statue is located across from the Victora & Albert Museum in London, in the Yalta Memorial Garden.

When we sliced this model, we had a feeling it would come out with an interesting texture. It also needed support for the parts, such as the chins of the faces, that run nearly horizontal. We printed this model at High Detail, the most fine layered setting available for a 0.4mm nozzle, with a layer height of 0.08mm. The print time duration was 12 hours and 23 minutes.

After the print completed, the support material snapped off very easily. We used the 'tree support' option in Orca Slicer to produce more easily removable support.
