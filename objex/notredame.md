# Printing Details
We wondered how well the 3D printer could handle an especially intricate model. We chose a STL file that captured the architectural ornamentation of Notre Dame de Paris to find out. 

To increase our chances of success with this model, we chose to print in High Detail and reduced the print speed by 100 mm/s on most of the layer types. These settings allowed the printer to lay down the filament in a way that bridged overhangs and accomplished minute patterns.

The team of 3D model creators named [MiniWorld3D](https://www.printables.com/@MiniWorld3D) created [this model](https://www.printables.com/model/274437-notre-dame-de-paris-france/files) of the Cathedral de Notre Dame in Paris.

We downloaded it and printed it at an enlarged size and high detail. The filament is a translucent gray. The print time was about ten hours.

The result demonstrates the high level of complexity and detail capable with 3D printing.
