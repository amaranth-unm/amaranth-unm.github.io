# Printing Details
We wondered how well the 3D printer could handle an especially intricate model. We chose a STL file that captured the architectural ornamentation of Notre Dame de Paris to see what would happen. 3D printers sometimes accomplish a surprising amount of fine detail work. This time, we chose to print in High Detail and lowered the print speed by 100 mm/s on most of the layer types. These settings allowed the printer to lay down the filament in a way that bridged overhangs and accomplished minute patterns.

The team of 3D model creators named [MiniWorld3D](https://www.printables.com/@MiniWorld3D) created [this model](https://www.printables.com/model/274437-notre-dame-de-paris-france/files) of the Cathedral de Notre Dame in Paris.

We downloaded it and printed it at an enlarged size and high detail. The filament is a translucent gray. The print time was about ten hours.

The result demonstrates the high level of complexity and detail capable with 3D printing.
