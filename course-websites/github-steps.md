## Initial Steps with Amaranth
Once you have [set up a GitHub account](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/getting-started), we will help you make a copy of the repository on Amaranth's account for the website template that you want to use for your course. This is called [forking](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-setup.html) the repository. After you do that, you will have a complete copy of all the files that create the entire template website. This is now yours to edit; you play around with it while leaving the original alone. For example, you can begin typing over the placeholder text for [the title](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/editing-your-site) of the website. We'll give you a tour of [the various places in the repository](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/guides/understanding-your-site) that hold files that you will edit to make the website specific to your course. Once you have finished making changes for the day, you will request a merge with the repository in Amaranth. This process is called submitting a 'pull request.' When we accept your pull request, the changes you made will be merged and the website hosted from Amaranth's repository will reflect the changes you made. 

## A Summary of What Your Students Will Do
Just as you did, your students will also create a GitHub account and [fork the repository](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-setup.html) from Amaranth's GitHub account. Since they will make their repositories public, you will be able to see any changes they make. Each student will [create their own folder](https://fredgibbs.net/courses/artificial-history/campus-history-new-page.html) and fill that folder with their images and a text file with the content of their page of the website. They will not make edits to any other part of the website. We recommend that students only submit a single pull request when they have finished making all changes. 

## A Few New Skills
To understand the basic elements of a website and its pages, you and your students will become familiar with the basics of coding language. Fortunately, this really means only learning a few special characters in order to generate features such as headings, italics, image captions, and footnotes. This simplified coding language is called [markdown](https://fredgibbs.net/xanthan/samples/typography).
