## 3D Terrain and Friction Maps

This use case includes printing basic terrain as well as exploring additional 3D features to represent borderlands concepts.

## Recommendations for 3D Printing Terrain

For a quick way to obtain a STL file for terrain, go to [Touch Terrain](https://touchterrain.geol.iastate.edu/main) created by Iowa State University.

## Use Multicolor Mode to Create Visible Layers

The 3D printer in Amaranth supports multi-colored printing. This can be done by layer, so as to further illustrate elevation and topography.
