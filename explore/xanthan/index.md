Xanthan and Amaranth grew up together. The framework started as a personal project---a set of Jekyll templates assembled to solve the problems that kept appearing in studio work---but it's long since stopped being one person's project. Every course, every consultation, every student site built in the studio has fed back into the framework. And the framework has shaped how the studio works: what we can offer, what we teach, what kinds of projects are possible. At this point, neither would exist in its current form without the other.


## A refusal of the standard bargain

Most academic web publishing advice amounts to picking the least-bad platform. Squarespace if you want it to look decent. WordPress if you want flexibility. Institutional systems if you want to comply. The implicit promise is that you trade control for convenience---and when the platform changes its terms, updates its look, or sunsets your plan, you adapt.

Xanthan started as a refusal of that bargain. It's built on Jekyll and GitHub Pages: open source, free to host, no vendor lock-in, no subscription. Sites are plain-text files in a version-controlled repository. The infrastructure is as durable as the open web itself, which is the most durable thing we have.

That's not just a technical preference. It's an argument about what digital humanities work should be able to promise its audiences---that a site built today won't disappear behind a paywall next year, that a student portfolio will still exist when the student needs it, that a class archive will outlast the grant that funded it.


## Why we keep improving it

Every semester teaches us something a clean-room design process wouldn't. A student discovers that changing a font requires editing a file she's never seen. A professor needs to embed a map and the documentation doesn't cover it. A scroll narrative looks perfect on a laptop and breaks on a phone.

These aren't failures---they're data. The framework is a record of everything we've learned about what academic web publishing actually requires, accumulated through real projects with real stakes.

The newest frontier is AI legibility. We've been deliberately designing Xanthan so that AI assistants can understand and modify it precisely: semantic CSS variable names, modular components with documented parameters, YAML configuration instead of buried settings. That design decision reflects a broader claim about where humanities web publishing is headed---toward a model where the scholar holds editorial authority and AI handles technical translation, rather than the other way around.


## What Xanthan offers

Four templates (Portfolio, Class Project, ScrollStory, and a full-featured version with the complete design system), a CSS design system built on custom properties for easy visual customization, and a library of Liquid includes with documented parameters. Sites work across devices, load quickly, and require nothing beyond a GitHub account to publish.

The documentation is at [xanthan-web.github.io](https://xanthan-web.github.io)---written for people who are new to these tools, with AI-assisted workflows throughout.

## Take it further

The full Xanthan documentation covers everything from setting up your first site in fifteen minutes to building a scroll-driven narrative with a custom theme. It's designed for people who haven't done this before---and for AI assistants who can do the technical work while you make the decisions.
