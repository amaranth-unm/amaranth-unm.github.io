# Amaranth Research Group

This semester’s independent study students are exploring how digital tools reshape storytelling, preservation, pedagogy, and public memory. Their projects reflect the heart of digital humanities: combining technical experimentation with human questions about culture, history, and experience.

## Damian Chavez

**3D Printing for High School History Classrooms**

Damian is exploring how 3D printing can transform the teaching of history in secondary education. By designing and producing tactile historical objects, he investigates how material engagement changes student learning, curiosity, and retention.

In digital humanities terms, this work bridges fabrication and pedagogy. It asks how digital models become physical artifacts that invite embodied learning. Rather than treating history as abstract text on a page, 3D printing reintroduces scale, texture, and spatial thinking into historical inquiry. Damian’s project highlights how emerging technologies can deepen access and spark creativity in classroom environments.

## Vanessa Salazar

**3D Scanning Peruvian Artifacts at the Maxwell Museum**

Vanessa is conducting high-resolution 3D scans of Peruvian artifacts housed at the Maxwell Museum. Her project focuses not only on digitization, but on documenting workflows and establishing best practices for future scanning initiatives.

This work contributes to digital humanities by strengthening the infrastructure of preservation. Careful documentation of process ensures that digital surrogates are not simply technical outputs, but responsibly created cultural records. By formalizing workflows, Vanessa’s research supports sustainability, reproducibility, and ethical stewardship in museum digitization projects.

## Grace Tomallo & Dillon Taylor

**Campus Food Stories and Memory**

Grace and Dillon are collecting food stories from across campus to understand how personal food memories shape identity, belonging, and community.

Their project sits at the intersection of oral history and digital storytelling. By gathering narrative data and curating it for public engagement, they demonstrate how digital humanities methods amplify everyday experiences. Food becomes an archive of emotion, migration, ritual, and care. Through structured collection and presentation, their work transforms personal memory into shared cultural knowledge.

## Eli Salway

**Museums and Immersive Digital Technologies**

Eli is surveying how museums are adopting immersive technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive installations. His research examines not only implementation, but also how these technologies are contextualized for audiences.

Digital humanities thrives on critical engagement with tools, not just adoption. Eli’s project asks important questions: Are immersive technologies enhancing interpretation or overshadowing it? How are institutions framing digital experiences within broader narratives of history and culture? His work contributes to a more reflective, theory-informed approach to digital innovation in museums.

Together, these projects demonstrate that digital humanities is not a single method but a constellation of practices. From fabrication to scanning, storytelling to immersive analysis, these students are building bridges between technology and the deeply human work of meaning-making.
