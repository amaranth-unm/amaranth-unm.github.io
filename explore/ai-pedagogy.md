# Humanistic Literacy, Open Practice, and Undergraduate Innovation

Rather than focusing on technical research or computational modeling, Amaranth emphasizes humanistic AI fluency through project-based learning, open workflows, and public scholarship.

Artificial intelligence is reshaping how knowledge is created, organized, and interpreted. From a humanistic perspective, AI is not only a technical system. It is also a narrative machine that generates stories, an archive machine that filters and organizes information, a classification machine that structures identities, and a historical actor shaping institutions and cultural memory. These transformations demand interpretive, ethical, and historical awareness as much as technical skill. Amaranth positions undergraduate education at the center of this work.


## Humanities for AI
Amaranth also contributes humanistic perspectives to broader campus and community conversations about artificial intelligence. We bring expertise in interpretation, ethics, and historical analysis to institutional discussions about data, knowledge, and technology. This work positions the humanities not as recipients of technological change, but as essential guides in shaping its direction.


## Why Undergraduate AI Literacy Matters
While many digital humanities initiatives focus on faculty research, Amaranth prioritizes undergraduate explorations with technology. Students are already using AI in their daily and academic lives, but often without frameworks for evaluating reliability, bias, or authority. We believe that the humanities play a crucial role in helping students move from passive consumption to critical partnership.


### Humanistic AI fluency includes:

- understanding how AI systems generate and structure knowledge
- evaluating sources, outputs, and assumptions
- recognizing bias, omission, and representation
- engaging ethical and cultural questions
- developing interpretive judgment and intellectual responsibility


AI becomes a tool for inquiry and interrogation rather than a shortcut. Students push back against pseudo-authority, probe AI boundaries, compare human and machine interpretations, critique outputs, and reflect on how digital systems shape meaning.

This approach prepares students not only for an emerging workforce, but for democratic and cultural participation in a rapidly changing information society. 



## Open and Transparent Engagement with AI

Amaranth foregrounds openness and transparency in digital work. Rather than hiding AI use, we model responsible engagement in public. Students document their workflows, prompts, revisions, and interpretive decisions. This emphasis on process supports reproducibility, accountability, and reflective learning.

Through open-source tools, shared documentation, and collaborative design, Amaranth creates environments where:

- students learn how digital knowledge is constructed
- experimentation is encouraged and failure is productive
- ethical reflection is integrated into technical practice
- learning is visible and cumulative

This transparency also helps instructors design assignments that align with learning goals and support academic integrity through intentional pedagogy.



## Public Humanities and Regional Context
Located in the American Southwest, Amaranth is committed to public engagement with diverse communities and knowledge traditions. Questions of language, representation, sovereignty, and cultural authority are central to our work. By engaging AI in public-facing contexts, we help students and partners explore how emerging technologies intersect with regional histories and futures.
