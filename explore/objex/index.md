## What photographs miss

Each object in this collection is an experiment in what 3D reproduction can reveal that images can't. Scale, texture, the weight of a thing in your hand, the way details read differently when you can rotate them—these are qualities photographs systematically remove. Objex documents what we've printed, what we learned from it, and what questions each object raised.
