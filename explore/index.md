## Tools that earn their place

Not every emerging technology deserves a place in humanities scholarship. Some tools add friction without adding understanding. Some produce impressive outputs that don't actually help anyone think better. At Amaranth, we investigate which ones genuinely deepen the work—and why—by testing them in real classrooms, real projects, and real consultations. Then we share what we learn honestly: what worked, what didn't, and what we'd do differently.

This is active, ongoing research. The landscape shifts faster than any institution can track. What's true about AI this semester may not be true next year. What we know about 3D printing in the classroom keeps evolving as we do more of it. The questions below aren't settled. They're live.


## AI and the humanities

The most urgent question in our field isn't "how do we use AI?" It's something harder: what does humanistic thinking offer to a world being reshaped by AI? Humanists have spent centuries developing tools for exactly the problems AI raises—evaluating the authority of sources, understanding how knowledge gets constructed, asking who benefits from a particular framing. Those skills aren't supplementary to good AI use. They're foundational to it.

At Amaranth, we're investigating what it looks like to put undergraduates—not just faculty researchers—at the center of this work. We're asking how the act of sharing your scholarship publicly changes the precision and ambition of your thinking. And we're building open, transparent workflows that model accountable engagement with AI rather than hiding it.

## 3D Pedagogy

What changes when students can hold a 3D-printed architectural capital instead of looking at a photograph? When a terrain map becomes something you can trace with your fingers rather than interpret through a flat screen?

We're investigating how 3D fabrication changes learning and research in the humanities—how physical objects restore scale, texture, and direct comparison to inquiry that photographs can't. Our projects range from printing Romanesque and Gothic capitals for art history courses to creating terrain models that make geographic relationships tangible in ways no image can.

## Open scholarship and the Xanthan framework

Open scholarship isn't just a publishing preference. In an AI era, it changes the kind of thinking you do. When your work is public, the pressure to be precise—in your argument, your evidence, your framing—is different. Visibility is a forcing function for clarity.

Xanthan is our open-source web framework for humanities projects, built from years of studio practice. It's free to host, requires no vendor lock-in, and is designed so that AI assistants can understand and modify it—making sophisticated web publishing accessible to scholars who've never written a line of code. Every site built on Xanthan is an experiment in what sustainable, scholar-owned digital work looks like.

## The Objex collection

A curated archive of 3D-scanned objects—historical artifacts, architectural details, museum pieces—built to support teaching and research. Each scan in the collection is an experiment in what digital reproduction can reveal about material culture: what you gain when you can rotate an object on screen, and what you still lose compared to holding it.

## Student research

The Amaranth Research Group brings undergraduates into live research questions at the intersection of humanities and emerging technology. Current projects include 3D printing for high school history classrooms, digitization of museum artifacts, campus food stories and oral history, and immersive technologies in museum interpretation.
