Not every emerging technology deserves a place in humanities scholarship. At Amaranth, we investigate which ones genuinely deepen the work---helping scholars reach wider audiences, make arguments in forms that text alone can't, or give students real ownership of what they build. We test in real classrooms and real projects, and we share what we learn honestly: what worked, what didn't, and why. That track record is the foundation of the guidance we offer.


## The horizon keeps moving

The landscape of possibility is expanding---3D fabrication, scroll-driven narratives, AI-assisted workflows, open-source publishing---but it's also shifting. What worked three years ago may already be obsolete; what works next year doesn't exist yet. AI is dissolving technical barriers that once separated scholars from sophisticated media production, but it's also raising new questions about authorship, judgment, and trust.

Best practices aren't handed down. They emerge through making, failing, revising, and sharing what you've learned. We investigate so we can recommend from experience rather than theory.


## Grounded in the classroom

Our explorations aren't abstract. They're tested in courses, workshops, and studio sessions at UNM---places where the stakes are real and the feedback is immediate. If a technology doesn't help someone think more clearly, communicate more effectively, or take genuine ownership of their work, we move on.

This means our research questions come from practice. What happens when students can hold a 3D-printed architectural capital instead of looking at a photograph? Can a scroll-driven narrative do things a traditional essay can't? How do you teach someone to make meaningful choices about design and media when AI is reshaping the entire landscape underneath them? The classroom is where we find out.


## Built to last

One of the most persistent problems in digital humanities is impermanence. Scholars build work on platforms that charge fees, lock in content, restrict design choices, and eventually disappear. Grants fund projects that go dark within five years. Student portfolios vanish when a subscription lapses.

We think the infrastructure should be as durable as the ideas it carries. That conviction shapes everything we build and recommend---open formats, plain text, version control, no vendor lock-in. Sustainable digital scholarship isn't just about keeping the lights on. It's about ensuring that the work remains accessible, portable, and under the control of the people who made it.


## What we're investigating

Our research isn't organized around discrete projects with predetermined outputs. It's organized around a broader question: how can emerging technologies deepen the questions humanists ask and expand the audiences they reach? Everything we build tests some part of that.


### 3D Pedagogy

We're investigating how 3D-printed objects can transform teaching and learning in the humanities. Images show us what something looks like, but they can't tell us how it feels, how heavy it is, or how it compares in size to something else. Printed replicas restore what images remove: the ability to rotate an object, trace its contours, and place it alongside others for direct comparison.

Our current projects explore [tactile architecture](/3d-printing/pedagogy/capitals)---printing Romanesque and Gothic capitals so students can feel the stylistic transition---and [terrain maps](/3d-printing/pedagogy/terrain) that make geographic relationships tangible in ways that flat screens cannot. Our [Objex collection](/3d-printing/objex) documents these experiments---each print testing what physical reproduction can reveal about scale, texture, and material presence.

### Xanthan

Our open-source web framework for humanities projects---built on Jekyll and GitHub Pages, designed to last decades rather than billing cycles. Xanthan is our answer to a persistent problem: scholars and students build digital work on platforms that charge fees, lock in content, and eventually disappear. We think the infrastructure should be as sustainable as the ideas it carries.

Xanthan powers class project sites, research portfolios, ScrollStory essays, and community archives---all free to host, fully owned by their creators, and built to outlive any single platform.
