The slicing software creates instructions for how to print an object for a particular printer. On the Mac workstations in the History Tech Lab, the software is set to default to the printer we have: the Anycubic Kobra 3. 

You can choose which of the four loaded filaments you want to use for your print.

- Open the Orca Slicer application and import the STL file you created from RevoScan. 

- Rotate it and snap it to the build plate, it should look like this:

- Adjust the dimensions and any other print settings. 
- Click “Slice plate” at the top of the screen.

Make sure that the file is saved in the file type of .gcode and it should look like this after the software slices the object.

Save the .gcode file to a USB drive and then insert that drive into the port on the printer. 
Before printing, check:
- The nozzle for any filament buildup
- The tubes for any breaks in the filament
- Use the touchpad to select your print file from the USB drive. Watch the printing for at least the first two layers of the object. 

Cancel the print if:
- The filament fails to load
- The filament begins to bubble over the nozzle
- The filament fails to adhere to the build plate

After the first three layers have printed successfully, you can leave the printer and return when the print is completed. Make a note to yourself--maybe a reminder on your phone--when to return to pick up the completed print and turn off the printer.
