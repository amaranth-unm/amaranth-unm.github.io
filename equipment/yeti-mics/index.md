Amaranth owns two YETI Blue microphones for high quality audio recording. We have tested the microphones and found that the sound quality is indistinguishable from that of the audio recording booths in Zimmerman Library. 

## Supporting Podcasts
We offer support for students and instructors interested in recording and posting podcasts. Come talk to us about the possibilities!

## Software Options for Recording Audio
The Mac workstations and the PC laptop in the Amaranth studio all have Audacity installed. The Mac workstations also have Garage Band.

## Recording on Audacity

After just a little practice getting used to the basic controls on Audacity, it is a very user friendly application. Here are a few tips:
- Check that the recording input device is correct by clicking on the Audio Setup button in the top row of controls
- Click in the middle of an audio clip and then use Control+i to divide that clip into two parts
- Drag and drop audio files into Audacity after downloading them from Creative Commons sites like [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
