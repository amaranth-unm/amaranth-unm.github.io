The Amaranth studio owns two YETI Blue microphones for high quality audio recording. We have tested the microphones and found that the sound quality is indistinguishable from that of the audio recording booths in Zimmerman Library. 

## Supporting Podcasts

We offer support for students and instructors interested in recording and posting podcasts. One of our [sample websites](https://amaranth-unm.github.io/websites/examples) is tailored for a class repository of podcast episodes. 

## Software Options for Recording Audio

The Mac workstations and the PC laptop in the Amaranth studio all have Audacity installed. The Mac workstations also have Garage Band.
