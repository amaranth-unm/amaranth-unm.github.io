Amaranth owns two YETI Blue microphones for high quality audio recording. We have tested the microphones and found that the sound quality is indistinguishable from that of the audio recording booths in Zimmerman Library. 

## Supporting Podcasts
We offer support for students and instructors interested in recording and posting podcasts. Come talk to us about the possibilities!
