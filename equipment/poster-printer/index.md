## HP DesignJet T630

Amaranth's poster printer, the HP DesignJet T630 allows for prints up to 36 inches.

The printer uses inkjet cartridges, which are expensive to replace, so please read through the below tips to save resources.

## Directions
### Format your file to print at a large scale
- These directions apply to printing an image file as well as a PDF
- When you create your file, set its size to a width of 36 inches
- For height, there's no limit, but a 24-inch height is standard for conference posters
- View your file at 100% so that you catch any images that might come out blurry or pixellated
- After you click Print, the top of the dialog box should show *HP DesignJet T630 36-in* as the selected printer (you can choose it from the pulldown menu if it's not the default)

### Choose the correct settings in the Print dialog box
**For Macs, follow these instructions:**
{% include figure.html
  class="right"
  width="50%"
  caption="The usual default settings will NOT work correctly"
  image-path="images/mac-36x24-jpg-or-pdf-dialog-box-initial.png"
%}

Notice the problems with the usual default settings in the print dialog box
- The print preview should not show extra space around the edges
- The Paper Size should not be US Letter
