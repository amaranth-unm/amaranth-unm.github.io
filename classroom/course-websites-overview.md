# Purpose
This overview explains how we help instructors create websites for the work their students produce in a course. 

# Understand How It Works
Many popular website creation apps, such as Wordpress or Wix, place limits on design and function. When creating a website at the last minute, those apps get the basic job done. However, these apps involve so many layers of code that even someone with intermediate web design experience cannot understand how they work. In addition, these apps diminish student agency over the look and feel of the page they contribute to the site. Our process, using GitHub Pages, results in a website with similar design features as a Wordpress site, but will also help students gain experience with website design and introductory coding. The steps involved in creating a website through GitHub Pages reinforce a collaborative ethos and provides a clear picture of how basic code produces design elements on a page.
