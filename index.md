When you print a Romanesque capital next to a Gothic one, the differences aren't just visual---they're <em>felt</em>. Understanding spatial relationships, terrain, and material culture starts with touch."

# Humanities work deserves to be seen, heard, and experienced

We help students, scholars, educators, and communities create work that doesn't just exist online---it *communicates*. Through intentional design, open technology, and deep engagement with humanities questions, we bring research and storytelling into public life.

We envision a future where the humanities thrive through emerging technologies---where *how* you present your work is as powerful as the work itself.

## Work with us
We want to get students and scholars excited about using technology and design to keep humanities vibrant. If you've ever imagined a digital project as part of course assignments, a research initiative, or community work---we can help make it happen.

We provide the technical infrastructure, process guides,hands-on training, and design support. Whether it's a collaborative class archive, a set of ScrollStory essays, a podcast series, or something we haven't thought of yet---let's build it together.

Please drop by studio hours, email us at <amaranth@unm.edu>, or [book a consultation](collaborate).
