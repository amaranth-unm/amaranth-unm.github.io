# Welcome to Amaranth
We help bring technology and the humanities together. We empower students, scholars, educators, and communities to create immersive, interactive stories and archives that invite critical engagement with core humanities issues. 

Through collaborative projects, open-access resources, and experimental digital platforms, we aim to bring humanities research into public discourse. We envision a future where the humanities are not in crisis, but are thriving through emerging technologies.

# Course integrations
We want to get students excited about using technology to keep humanities vibrant.If you've ever done or thought about a digtial project as part of course assignments (or extra credit), we can help! Our goal is to provide the technical infrastructure, training, and support (for both faculty and students), so that we can handle the digital components, and instructors can focus on their content.
