# We help you make things that matter

Amaranth is UNM's digital humanities studio. We support students and faculty in building websites, oral histories, digital exhibits, and interactive narratives that carry scholarship into the world. You own your work, choose your medium intentionally, and communicate ideas that resonate with a broad audiences. We have slightly different [digital humanities priorities](studio/digital-humanities).

At Amaranth, [AI is both a building tool and a subject of inquiry](explore/ai-pedagogy). We use it to help scholars and students produce work faster than ever---lowering the technical barrier so ideas can take center stage. And we help people understand what AI actually does, what it gets wrong, and how to work with it in ways that keep human judgment in the driver's seat.

[There's also a reason we're called Amaranth](studio/why-amaranth). In Greek, *amarantos* means "unfading"---and the plant itself ranges from sacred grain to agricultural superweed depending on who's growing it and why. Both qualities inform what we do: a commitment to building things that last, and a belief that digital humanities is stronger when it grows in many directions at once.

## Come build something

Some of the best work starts as a half-formed question, a vague idea, something you're not sure is even possible. That's exactly the right time to talk.

We work alongside you, teaching the thinking behind technical and design decisions so you can carry it forward. Whether it's a class assignment, a research project, or something you haven't quite figured out yet---action reduces anxiety. 

Drop by studio hours, email us at <amaranth@unm.edu>, or [book a consultation](collaborate).
