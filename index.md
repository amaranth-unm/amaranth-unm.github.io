# Keep the humanities vibrant

Amaranth is UNM's digital humanities studio. **We focus on helping scholars and students use technology to *communicate* the significance of their work** reaaching broad audiences with collaborative websites, oral histories, podcasts, virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, and interactive narratives built on open infrastructure they control. **Design matters**—not as decoration, but to help ideas reach people. You don't need professional training to make deliberate visual choices that strengthen your message and connect with your audience. Public scholarship and digital pedagogy isn't an add-on. It's the point. [Read how Amaranth fits into the digital humanities →](studio/digital-humanities)

**Central to our mission: humanists need to help guide AI practices**. The interpretive habits built through close reading, archival research, and critical analysis---evaluating sources, questioning frames, recognizing biases---are exactly what responsible AI use requires. We guide collaborators through an iterative AI workflow, starting with technical work where feedback is immediate, building fluency that transfers into research, writing, and teaching. [How we approach AI pedagogy →](explore/ai-pedagogy)

**We're practitioners, not evangelists.** We test tools in real classrooms and real projects, share what we learn honestly, and build on open-source infrastructure with stability at its core. This is a coaching studio, not a service desk---we work alongside you, teaching the thinking behind decisions so you can carry the work forward and keep learning.

## Come build something

Some of the best work starts as a half-formed question, a vague idea, something you're not sure is even possible. That's exactly the right time to talk.

We work alongside you, teaching the thinking behind technical and design decisions so you can carry it forward. Whether it's a class assignment, a research project, or something you haven't quite figured out yet---action reduces anxiety. 

Drop by studio hours, email us at <amaranth@unm.edu>, or [book a consultation](collaborate).
