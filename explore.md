# A new digital humanities

Digital humanities has spent the better part of two decades building powerful ways to analyze humanities materials at scale. Text mining, topic modeling, network analysis, corpus linguistics---these methods let scholars ask questions across thousands of texts, map relationships that close reading alone can't reveal, and find patterns in archives too large for any individual to survey. That work has produced real insights and it continues to matter.

But analysis is only half of scholarship. The other half---how ideas take shape, how arguments find their form, how the work actually reaches people and whether it survives---has been treated as someone else's problem. Build the corpus, run the model, write up the findings. The website is an afterthought. The visualization is a default chart. The archive interface is whatever the platform provides. The infrastructure belongs to a vendor who may not exist in five years.

We've watched this pattern play out across the field, and we think something important gets lost in it. Not just aesthetics or usability---though those matter---but the *argument itself*. A scroll-based narrative makes a different claim than a PDF. A 3D-printed artifact carries different evidence than a photograph of one. A website you own and control says something different about sustainability than one locked inside a platform that charges rent. These aren't production details. They're interpretive choices, and they deserve the same critical attention as the research question that produced them.

Amaranth focuses there.


## The making is the thinking

We're a digital humanities studio, not a service center. The distinction matters. We don't process data for scholars or build tools they'll never understand. We work alongside students, faculty, and community partners as they make things---websites, podcasts, ScrollStories, 3D-printed objects, visual narratives---and we treat every design decision along the way as a scholarly one.

This is what we mean by technical fluency: not the ability to write code (though that can help), but the ability to make informed, intentional choices about the tools, media, and platforms through which your work enters the world. We believe scholars should understand their own methods---all of them, including the ones that happen after the analysis is done. A humanist who knows *why* they chose a particular format, platform, or design approach is doing better scholarship than one who handed those decisions to someone else.

So our work is teaching. Not lectures about technology, but the kind of learning that happens when you're building something that matters to you and someone helps you understand what you're choosing and why. Think of a pottery studio: someone shows you how to center the clay, but you're the one at the wheel.


## AI and the current moment

AI is already reshaping how people write, design, build, and communicate---including in the humanities. Most institutional responses so far have been either uncritical enthusiasm or anxious prohibition. Neither is serious. We think there's a more productive path: developing enough understanding of these tools to make genuine choices about when they serve your work and when they don't.

This is the same principle we apply to everything in the studio. Don't outsource your judgment. Learn enough to decide for yourself. AI can be a powerful collaborator for drafting, prototyping, troubleshooting, and exploring design possibilities---but only if you understand what it's doing well enough to trust it or override it. We're developing open resources for AI-assisted humanities work that any scholar or institution can use, and we're building AI guidance directly into our tools and workshops.

The humanities have always been about how people make meaning. AI doesn't change that question---it raises the stakes.


## What we're investigating

Our research agenda isn't organized around discrete projects with predetermined outputs. It's organized around a broader question: can we move the needle on how humanists engage with technology and how their scholarship reaches the world? Everything we build tests some part of that.


### 3D Pedagogy

We're investigating how 3D-printed objects can transform teaching and learning in the humanities. Images show us what something looks like, but they can't tell us how it feels, how heavy it is, or how it compares in size to something else. Printed replicas restore what images remove: the ability to rotate an object, trace its contours, and place it alongside others for direct comparison.

Our current projects explore [tactile architecture](/3d-printing/pedagogy/capitals)---printing Romanesque and Gothic capitals so students can feel the stylistic transition---and [terrain maps](/3d-printing/pedagogy/terrain) that make geographic relationships tangible in ways that flat screens cannot. Our [Objex collection](/3d-printing/objex) documents these experiments---each print testing what physical reproduction can reveal about scale, texture, and material presence.

### Xanthan

Our open-source web framework for humanities projects---built on Jekyll and GitHub Pages, designed to last decades rather than billing cycles. Xanthan is our answer to a persistent problem: scholars and students build digital work on platforms that charge fees, lock in content, and eventually disappear. We think the infrastructure should be as sustainable as the ideas it carries.

Xanthan powers class project sites, research portfolios, ScrollStory essays, and community archives---all free to host, fully owned by their creators, and built to outlive any single platform.
