## A workshop, not a service desk

Amaranth lives in Mesa Vista Hall at UNM---a workspace where students, scholars, and community members come together to experiment with technology, design, and humanities storytelling. Whether you're printing a 3D model, editing a podcast, building a ScrollStory, or just thinking through a project idea, the studio is a place to try things, get feedback, and learn by doing.

You don't need an appointment to stop by during studio hours. Bring your laptop, bring a project, or just bring curiosity. People work on their own things alongside each other, ask questions, share what they're learning, and help each other troubleshoot. Think of it like a pottery studio: someone shows you how to center the clay, but you're the one at the wheel.


## Come by

**Spring 2026 studio hours:** Tuesdays & Thursdays 9:30--11:00 and 12:30--2:00, Wednesdays 10:00--12:00.
