## What are the digital humanities?

Digital humanities is a broad term for work that brings computational methods and digital tools into conversation with humanistic inquiry. That conversation has taken many forms over the decades---from concordances and databases to text mining, mapping, 3D modeling, and interactive storytelling. What ties it together is less any single method and more a shared commitment: that the questions humanists ask about culture, history, language, and meaning can be enriched (and sometimes transformed) by digital approaches.

The term is intentionally capacious. Some digital humanities work looks like traditional scholarship augmented by new tools---a historian using GIS to map migration patterns, a literary scholar running computational analyses across thousands of novels. Other work is more experimental, building interactive archives, digital exhibits, podcasts, or immersive narratives that reach audiences well beyond the academy. The field has always moved between these poles of analysis and making, and both matter.


## A brief history of the field

The roots of digital humanities stretch back further than most people realize. In 1949, an Italian Jesuit named Roberto Busa began working with IBM to create a computer-generated concordance of the works of Thomas Aquinas. The project took decades. It was painstaking, unglamorous, and utterly foundational---it demonstrated that computation could serve humanistic scholarship, not just scientific or military purposes.

For most of the second half of the twentieth century, this kind of work went by the name **humanities computing**. It was a small, specialist community focused on text encoding, linguistic analysis, and database construction. The work was rigorous and technically demanding, but it remained marginal to mainstream humanities departments. Most humanists didn't encounter it, and many who did weren't sure what to make of it.

The shift to "digital humanities" as a term---catalyzed by the publication of the *Companion to Digital Humanities* in 2004---signaled something more than a rebranding. It marked an expansion of scope. Where humanities computing had been primarily about applying computational methods to traditional scholarly questions, digital humanities began to encompass a wider range of practices: building digital archives and exhibits, experimenting with new forms of publishing, creating interactive media, and asking how digital culture itself reshapes what it means to be human.

The late 2000s and early 2010s saw a surge of institutional investment. The NEH Office of Digital Humanities (established 2008) began funding projects. Major universities created DH centers. Foundations like Mellon and ACLS launched fellowship programs. For a while, digital humanities carried an almost messianic energy---declarations that DH would "save the humanities" or that every humanist would need to code. Conference panels debated whether DH was a field, a method, a community, or a moment.

That hype cycle was probably inevitable, and it has largely passed. What replaced it is more interesting.


## Where the field stands now

The most significant development in digital humanities over the past several years isn't a new tool or method. It's a maturation of the field's self-understanding.

**The methods have dispersed.** Text analysis, mapping, network visualization, digital storytelling, and data-driven research are no longer the province of dedicated DH centers alone. They've been absorbed into departments, programs, and individual research practices across the humanities and social sciences. A historian who builds an interactive map for a research project may not call it "digital humanities," but the methods and sensibilities come from that lineage. This dispersal is a sign of success, even if it sometimes makes the field harder to point to.

**The questions have deepened.** Early DH work was sometimes criticized for being method-driven---applying tools because they existed rather than because they answered pressing questions. The best current work reverses this. Scholars start with humanistic questions---about power, representation, absence, memory---and reach for digital methods when they genuinely serve the inquiry. Critical data studies, algorithmic bias research, postcolonial digital humanities, and community-driven archiving have brought sharper political and ethical awareness to the field.

**Public-facing work has gained legitimacy.** Digital exhibits, podcasts, community archives, documentary projects, and interactive narratives are increasingly recognized as serious scholarly contributions, not just outreach or service. This matters enormously. It means that work aimed at public audiences---work that communicates, engages, and invites participation---can be central to a scholar's intellectual life, not peripheral to it.

**AI has changed the conversation.** The emergence of large language models and generative AI has reshaped the landscape dramatically. Humanists are now grappling with questions about authorship, creativity, bias, and the nature of knowledge that have been core to their disciplines for centuries---but in a new and urgent register. At the same time, AI tools have lowered the barrier to technical work in ways that make digital humanities methods more accessible than ever. You no longer need to learn a programming language to do sophisticated text analysis or build a compelling interactive project. You need good questions and editorial judgment.

**The institutional picture is mixed.** Some DH centers have thrived; others have lost funding or been folded into libraries and IT units. The field continues to face structural challenges in higher education: tenure and promotion systems that undervalue digital work, precarious labor for the staff who build and maintain projects, and the ongoing difficulty of sustaining digital projects over time. None of these are solved. But the intellectual vitality of the field isn't in question.


## What Amaranth does differently

Amaranth is UNM's Digital Humanities and Public Scholarship Studio, and its approach reflects where the field has arrived---and where it needs to go.

**Scholarship should reach people.** The studio's emphasis on public scholarship isn't an add-on. It's the starting point. The most powerful humanistic work doesn't just produce knowledge---it communicates it. Amaranth supports faculty and students in building websites, digital exhibits, podcasts, oral history projects, and interactive narratives that bring research to wider audiences. The goal isn't to simplify scholarship for public consumption. It's to take communication as seriously as analysis.

**Tools should serve questions, not the other way around.** Amaranth provides access to equipment and training---3D printers, audio recording gear, large-format printing, VR headsets---but the studio isn't organized around technology. It's organized around what people are trying to do. A faculty member developing an oral history project gets support for the entire workflow: planning, recording, editing, archiving, and publishing. The technology is instrumental, not the point.

**AI changes what's possible.** Amaranth's approach to web development through [Xanthan](https://xanthan-web.github.io), its open-source website framework, is built around a specific insight: AI assistants work best when they have clearly structured, well-documented materials to work with. Xanthan uses named variables, modular components, and plain-language configuration so that users can direct AI to make sophisticated changes to their sites without writing code themselves. This isn't about replacing expertise---it's about redistributing creative control. The person with the intellectual vision should be able to shape the final product, even if they've never written a line of CSS.

**Access matters more than expertise.** The studio is open to anyone at UNM---faculty, students, staff---regardless of technical background. There's no prerequisite knowledge, no application process, no expectation that you arrive knowing what you need. Amaranth exists to lower barriers, not raise them. That commitment to access is itself a stance within digital humanities, where the gap between well-resourced institutions and everyone else remains one of the field's persistent problems.


## Digital humanities at UNM

UNM doesn't have a formal digital humanities program or center, which makes Amaranth's role both more important and more unusual. The studio functions as a hub for DH-adjacent work across departments---history, English, art, communication, and beyond---connecting people who might not otherwise know they're working on related problems.

As digital humanities continues to evolve at UNM, this page will grow to reflect new projects, partnerships, and programs. For now, Amaranth is where the work is happening.
