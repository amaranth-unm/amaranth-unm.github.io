# Tips and Guidelines for Oral Histories
The below information is adapted from publications available on [the website of the Oral History Association](https://oralhistory.org/).

## As a First Step, Plan the Purpose and Scope of the Oral History Project
- Ask: Why am I doing this project? Who or what will it document (a person, a community, an event, a place)?
- Define research questions or themes.
- Decide the scope: how many interviews, over what time, with which kinds of narrators, what geographic/community scope.
- Identify the audience (academic, public history, exhibition, web archive) and how the material will be used.
- Check for pre-existing collections: is something similar already done, or will your project add new voices?

## Identify Narrators and Build a Relationship with Them
- Choose narrators whose experiences are relevant to the topic and who bring diverse perspectives (age, gender, ethnicity, role). 
- Establish rapport: have a pre-interview meeting/discussion to explain the project, process, consent, rights, what the narrator can expect. 
- Be transparent: explain how the interview will be recorded, how it will be used/preserved, what review rights the narrator may have, what happens to transcripts, etc. 
- Respect agency: narrators should know they can decline topics, stop recording, or withdraw.

## Interview Preparation
- Do your homework: research the topic, community, relevant history so you come to the interview informed (so you can ask good follow-ups, contextualise what they say). 
- Prepare an interview guide or outline of open-ended questions and topic areas rather than a rigid script. 
- Prepare equipment: test audio/video gear, external microphones, check sound environment, ensure batteries/back-ups. 
- Select a suitable environment: quiet, comfortable, minimal distractions; set up so narrator and interviewer are comfortable, can see each other, etc. 
- If applicable, prepare the ethical/legal forms: consent forms, release forms (for audio/video, for use of materials), data-protection.

## During the Interview
- Start with simple, warm-up questions: name, place of birth, early life — to help narrator relax. 
- Use open-ended questions (“Can you describe…”, “What was it like when…”) rather than yes/no or leading questions. 
- Listen actively, follow up, allow silences, allow the narrator to speak at length, rather than you dominating. 
- Be sensitive to difficult topics (trauma, loss, contested memory). Build trust, allow narrator to pass on questions. 
- Capture as best possible: play back a test recording to ensure that the volume is recording correctly.

## Ethical Considerations
- Narrators are not just “sources” — they are people with agency, rights, and histories. Consider power relations (interviewer/interviewee), community context, consent, representation. 
- Be clear about how the interview might be used (publications, websites, exhibitions). Make sure narrators understand and agree. 
- Respect confidentiality and sensitive material: sometimes parts of an interview may need to be redacted or embargoed.
- Return value / benefit to the community: think about how the narrators or their communities might benefit (public sharing, exhibitions, copies for narrators, local events).
