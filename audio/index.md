# Every voice has a story

Some of the most important humanities work happens in conversation and in dialogue, researchers discussing their work, students preserving food stories through collecting oral histories, scholars telling a story to their audience. Audio captures what text alone cannot: inflection, hesitation, laughter, silence. The aural landscape of a story tells you something that no transcript can.

We help scholars and students use audio as a medium for humanities work---not just as a recording tool, but as a way to design experiences that honor the people and stories at the center of the work.


## Oral histories
An oral history is more than an interview. It's a relationship between narrator and listener shaped by trust, preparation, and ethical care. Done well, it preserves not just what someone said, but how they said it---and helps explain why it matters. Our [oral history guide](oral-histories) walks through the process from planning to preservation, drawing on frameworks from the Oral History Association.


## Podcasting
A podcast transforms a humanistic inquiry into a site of engagement. It's something people listen to on a commute, a walk, or while doing housework---times when they are not reading your genius article in that pretigious journal. It demands a different kind of writing---conversational, structured around curiosity, designed to hold attention through narrative rather than citation. Our [podcasting guide](podcasting) covers how to get started, from finding your hook to shaping episodes that keep listeners coming back.


## Getting started
You don't need professional equipment or experience. A phone and a quiet room get you surprisingly far, and the [YETI mics](/equipment/yeti-mics) in the studio are available for higher-quality recording. We have guides for [recording audio](recording) and [editing with Audacity](audacity)---a free, open-source editor that's more than capable for humanities audio work.

The hardest part isn't the technology. It's deciding what story you want to tell and whose voice should tell it. We can help with that too.
