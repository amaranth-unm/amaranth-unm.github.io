# Tips for Editing Audio Files with Audacity

After just a little practice getting used to the basic controls on Audacity, it is a very user friendly application. Here are a few tips:

- Check that the YETI mic as the recording input device is correctly connected by clicking on the Audio Setup button in the top row of controls

%}
<br style="clear: both">
- If the sound is recording at too high a volume, turn down the Gain dial on the back of the microphone

  width="45%"

%}
<br style="clear: both">
- Click in the middle of an audio clip and then use Control+i to divide that clip into two parts

- To remove verbal pauses, drag the cursor over a portion of an audio clip to select it for deletion and then hit the Delete key

<br style="clear: both">
- Drag and drop audio files into Audacity after downloading them from Creative Commons sites like [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). The new audio file will display as a second audio track below what you already recorded.
