# Mission: What we do
Our mission is to harness innovative digital technologies and digital design to illuminate the rich history of New Mexico. We empower scholars, educators, and communities to create immersive, interactive archives and storytelling experiences that invite critical engagement with core humanities issues. Through collaborative projects, open-access resources, and experimental digital platforms, we aim to bridge academic research with public discourse, fostering a deeper, more inclusive understanding of the human condition.

# Vision: What we dream
We envision a future where humanities scholarship is at the heart of digital transformation, making it accessible, dynamic, and globally resonant. Our studio strives to be a pioneering hub where humanistic inquiry, technology, and design convergeâ€”cultivating an environment that not only preserves but also reimagines the narratives that define our shared heritage. By breaking down traditional barriers to knowledge and sparking interdisciplinary conversations, we aspire foreground the stories that shape our world.

## Why Amaranth?
The word _amaranth_ originates from the Greek _amarantos_, which means unfading, in the sense of permanence or immortality. We refer to this association with a playful irony, as the speed of new innovation in digital technology often leads to a rather rapid fading of its products. This happens even as the persistence of digital humanities as an intellectual endeavor appears quite assured. 

Throughout history and into the present, people have used the dozens of species of Amaranth plants for a large variety of purposes, from medicines to dyes. Over the last few decades, a new set of digital technology tools and techniques emerged to provide humanists with many options for projects and research. The diversity of opportunities in the digital humanities thus lends itself to a metaphor that captures this idea of growth from variety.
