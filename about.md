# What is Amaranth?
Our mission is to harness innovative digital technologies and digital design to illuminate the rich history of New Mexico. We empower scholars, educators, and communities to create immersive, interactive archives and storytelling experiences that invite critical engagement with core humanities issues. Through collaborative projects, open-access resources, and experimental digital platforms, we aim to bridge academic research with public discourse, fostering a deeper, more inclusive understanding of the human condition.


We envision a future where humanities scholarship is at the heart of digital transformation, making it accessible, dynamic, and globally resonant. Our studio strives to be a pioneering hub where humanistic inquiry, technology, and design convergeâ€”cultivating an environment that not only preserves but also reimagines the narratives that define our shared heritage. By breaking down traditional barriers to knowledge and sparking interdisciplinary conversations, we aspire foreground the stories that shape our world.
